why program?
why program language?
python fundamentals.

5 constructor
1) Variable arthimetic and operation
2) Sequence
3) Selection or conditional
4) Iteration
5) Functions or repetation
 
problem solving techniques:
1)Algorithm
2)Pseudocode
3)Flowchart



1)know your age and citizenship. 

2)conform whether u are above and equal to 18 .

3)To apply collect the required documents

4)then apply for voter id 

5)if it ok with all documents and age verfications,then finally u will receive voter id for voting within certain time span.



number system

decimal => 245 =>2×10^2+4×10^1+5×10^0
 	       => 200+40+5

binary  => 1011 => 1×2^3+0×2^2+1×2^1+1×2^0
 		=> 8+0+2+1=11

octal => 745 => 7×8^2+4×8^1+5×8^0
 	     => 448+32+5=485

hexadecimal (0 to 9 and A to F (A=10, B=11, ..., F=15))
	=> 3F => 3×16^1+15×16^0
 	      => 48+15=63

compiler => slow debugging vs interpreter => debugging easy



realtime purpose of compiler, interpreter 


what is faster python interpreter vs jupyter note
==> If you're focused on speed and performance, the Python interpreter is faster.
==> If you're focused on interactivity, visualization, and experimentation, Jupyter Notebook is more convenient.
