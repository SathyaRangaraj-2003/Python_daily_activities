why the layoff?


TCS is trying to prepare for the future by changing how it works. This includes:

1. Using AI more
They want to use artificial intelligence to improve their services and stay competitive.

2. Expanding into new markets
TCS is looking to grow in new areas and industries, which may need different skills than they currently have.

3. Realigning the workforce

This means they’re adjusting their teams to match the new direction of the company. Some roles may no longer be needed, while others are in high demand.

4. Reskilling and redeployment

They’re trying to train employees in new skills and move them to different roles. But this isn’t always possible for everyone.

So why the layoffs?
It’s not because AI is replacing people directly. Instead, it’s because:

Some employees don’t have the skills needed for the new roles.
In some cases, it’s not practical to retrain or move them to other positions.






Forward References in Python: Then vs. Now

When you wanted to use a class in a type hint before it was defined, you had to:

Use quotes around the class name:


class Node:
    def __init__(self, next: 'Node' = None):
        self.next = next

Or, import a future feature to simplify this:

from __future__ import annotations

class Node:
    def __init__(self, next: Node = None):
        self.next = next

In Python 3.14 and Later

Now, Python automatically treats all type hints as strings behind the scenes. So you can write:
