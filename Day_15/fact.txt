 AI age estimation system mistakenly identifies you as under 18, you’ll have three ways to verify your actual age:

🔐 Age Verification Options:
📄 Upload a Government ID

You can submit a photo of an official ID (like a driver’s license or passport).
YouTube will use secure systems to verify your age without storing sensitive data long-term.

💳 Use a Credit Card

A small transaction or verification charge may be used to confirm you're over 18.
This method is quick and doesn’t require uploading documents.

🤳 Take a Selfie

YouTube may ask you to record a short video or take a selfie.
AI will analyze facial features to estimate your age.
This method is designed to be fast and privacy-conscious.

These options will be offered only if the AI system flags your account incorrectly, and you’ll be notified with instructions on how to proceed.
