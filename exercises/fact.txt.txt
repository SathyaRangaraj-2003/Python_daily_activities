NASA and Google have teamed up to develop an AI-powered medical assistant called the Crew Medical Officer Digital Assistant (CMO-DA), designed to support astronauts during deep-space missions where real-time communication with Earth is limited


This AI assistant uses natural language processing, machine learning, and multi-modal inputs (speech, text, images) to help diagnose and treat medical issues autonomously. It’s hosted on Google Cloud’s Vertex AI and trained on spaceflight medical literature. In early trials, CMO-DA achieved diagnostic accuracy rates of up to 88% for conditions like ankle injuries and ear pain 2 3.

Beyond space, this technology could revolutionize healthcare in remote or underserved regions on Earth by providing reliable medical support where doctors aren't readily available.





Python libraries like Qiskit and Cirq are essential tools for quantum computing,

Qiskit is a Python-based framework for working with IBM Quantum computers.

Cirq is designed for Google’s quantum processors and focuses on quantum algorithm development.

Gate-level Control: Fine-tuned control over quantum gates and operations.
Quantum Error Correction: Tools to simulate and test fault-tolerant circuits.
Integration with TensorFlow Quantum: Combines classical ML with quantum computing.

Python + quantum = new possibilities in AI:



Forward References in Python: Then vs. Now

When you wanted to use a class in a type hint before it was defined, you had to:

Use quotes around the class name:


class Node:
    def __init__(self, next: 'Node' = None):
        self.next = next

Or, import a future feature to simplify this:

from __future__ import annotations

class Node:
    def __init__(self, next: Node = None):
        self.next = next

In Python 3.14 and Later

Now, Python automatically treats all type hints as strings behind the scenes. So you can write:
